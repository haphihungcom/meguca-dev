[title]List of news sources[/title]

[p]This is a list of news sources (newspapers, podcasts,...) that exist in the South Pacific. Both public and private news sources are listed. These news sources can cover anything from roleplays, regional politics, real-life opinions to meme and other silly stuff. Click on a link below will send you to the homepage/index dispatch or forum thread of a news source. News sources without an index/homepage dispatch are not listed for practical reasons.[/p]

{{ sign.note("Please telegram " ~ misc.newspaper_adder|nation ~ " with a link to your news source's homepage/index dispatch or forum thread in order to get your news source listed. [u]Please note that your news source needs to have a homepage/index dispatch which contains links to content you have published or a thread on our [url=f_news]journalism forum area[/url] in order for it to be listed on here[/u].", title="Don't see your newspaper on this?") }}
